Task 1:
Developing a Machine Learning Model for Classification

1.1 Project Summary

The objective of this initial task is to create a classification model aimed at predicting the presence or absence of heart disease based on a range of medical attributes. The accurate prediction of heart disease is of paramount importance.

1.2 Data Collection and Preparation

Data Source:

The dataset utilized for this task is obtained from the following link:
[Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ineubytes/heart-disease-dataset)

Data Overview:

The Heart Disease Dataset comprises a total of 76 attributes. However, for this project, we will focus on a subset of 14 attributes consistently employed in prior experiments. Notably, these experiments, conducted by researchers in the field of machine learning, have predominantly utilized the Cleveland database.

Task 2:
Construction of a Machine Learning Model for Regression

2.1 Project Overview

In this machine learning project, the primary objective is to construct a highly accurate predictive model for PM2.5 air pollution levels. PM2.5, a form of fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller, is a notable environmental pollutant with adverse impacts on health. By harnessing historical data encompassing meteorological and environmental parameters, our goal is to develop a model capable of forecasting PM2.5 concentrations within specific geographical areas.

Task 3: Major Internship Project
Predictive Analysis and Customer Segmentation for an E-Commerce Platform

3.1 Project Overview

This extensive project revolves around the "Online Retail II" dataset, which captures transactions from a UK-based online retail business spanning December 2009 to December 2011. Specializing in the sale of distinctive all-occasion giftware to both individual buyers and wholesalers, the project aims to derive actionable insights for refining business strategies by analyzing customer behavior, sales trends, and market dynamics.
